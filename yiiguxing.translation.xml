      <item value="The &lt;code&gt;DataOutput&lt;code&gt; interface provides for converting data from any of the Java primitive types to a series of bytes and writing these bytes to a binary stream. There is also a facility for converting a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;code&gt; into &lt;a href=&quot;DataInput.htmlmodified-utf-8&quot;&gt;modified UTF-8&lt;a&gt; format and writing the resulting series of bytes. &lt;p&gt; For all the methods in this interface that write bytes, it is generally true that if a byte cannot be written for any reason, an &lt;code&gt;IOException&lt;code&gt; is thrown." />

      <item value="Frank Yellin" />
      <item value="A data input stream lets an application read primitive Java data types from an underlying input stream in a machine-independent way. An application uses a data output stream to write data that can later be read by a data input stream. &lt;p&gt; DataInputStream is not necessarily safe for multithreaded access. Thread safety is optional and is the responsibility of users of methods in this class." />

      <item value="Filter Writer" />
      <item value="This class is the superclass of all classes that filter output streams. These streams sit on top of an already existing output stream (the &lt;i&gt;underlying&lt;i&gt; output stream) which it uses as its basic sink of data, but possibly transforming the data along the way or providing additional functionality. &lt;p&gt; The class &lt;code&gt;FilterOutputStream&lt;code&gt; itself simply overrides all methods of &lt;code&gt;OutputStream&lt;code&gt; with versions that pass all requests to the underlying output stream. Subclasses of &lt;code&gt;FilterOutputStream&lt;code&gt; may further override some of these methods as well as provide additional methods and fields." />

      <item value="The object used to synchronize operations on this stream. For efficiency, a character-stream object may use an object other than itself to protect critical sections. A subclass should therefore use the object in this field rather than &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;tt&gt; or a synchronized method." />

      <item value="A thread-safe variant of {@link java.util.ArrayList} in which all mutative operations ({@code add}, {@code set}, and so on) are implemented by making a fresh copy of the underlying array. &lt;p&gt;This is ordinarily too costly, but may be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;em&gt; efficient than alternatives when traversal operations vastly outnumber mutations, and is useful when you cannot or don't want to synchronize traversals, yet need to preclude interference among concurrent threads. The &quot;snapshot&quot; style iterator method uses a reference to the state of the array at the point that the iterator was created. This array never changes during the lifetime of the iterator, so interference is impossible and the iterator is guaranteed not to throw {@code ConcurrentModificationException}. The iterator will not reflect additions, removals, or changes to the list since the iterator was created. Element-changing operations on iterators themselves ({@code remove}, {@code set}, and {@code add}) are not supported. These methods throw {@code UnsupportedOperationException}. &lt;p&gt;All elements are permitted, including {@code null}. &lt;p&gt;Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a {@code CopyOnWriteArrayList} &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.htmlMemoryVisibility&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;i&gt;&lt;a&gt; actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from the {@code CopyOnWriteArrayList} in another thread. &lt;p&gt;This class is a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}..technotesguidescollectionsindex.html&quot;&gt; Java Collections Framework&lt;a&gt;." />
